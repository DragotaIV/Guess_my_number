"Guess My Number" is a classic number guessing game. The game is played between two players, where one player chooses a number in a predefined range, and the other player tries to guess that number by asking a series of questions.

In the single-player version of the game, the player thinks of a number within a predefined range, and the computer tries to guess it by asking a series of questions. The computer will keep narrowing down its guesses until it correctly guesses the number or exhausts all possible options.

The game is usually played with a range of numbers, such as 1 to 20 or 1 to 100, and the player gives hints to the other player after each guess, indicating whether the number is higher or lower than the previous guess. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

The game can be a fun way to pass the time and to exercise your deductive skills.
